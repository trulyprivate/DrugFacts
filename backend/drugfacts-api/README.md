# DrugFacts API Backend

NestJS backend service for the DrugFacts application that provides drug information from MongoDB.

## Description

This is the backend API service for DrugFacts, built with [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. It provides RESTful endpoints to access drug information stored in MongoDB.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend/drugfacts-api directory:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB_NAME=drug_facts

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL for CORS
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- `GET /health` - API health status

### Drug Endpoints
- `GET /api/drugs` - Search drugs with pagination
  - Query params: `q`, `therapeuticClass`, `manufacturer`, `page`, `limit`
- `GET /api/drugs/index` - Get all drugs in index.json format
- `GET /api/drugs/:slug` - Get drug by slug
- `GET /api/drugs/therapeutic-classes` - List all therapeutic classes
- `GET /api/drugs/manufacturers` - List all manufacturers
- `GET /api/drugs/count` - Get total drug count

## Testing the API

Use the included test script:
```bash
./test-api.sh
```

Or test manually:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Search drugs
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/drugs?q=aspirin&limit=5"

# Get drug by slug
curl http://localhost:3001/api/drugs/mounjaro
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
